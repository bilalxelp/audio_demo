But a purchaser should never make such a prayer room. Sir we are giving first check-payment to those who take it. We get them after they like it. How can you buy this? People don't know how to do that. Yes sir. I am wondering if God doesnot give a small room with 2 crores of building. Sir, what is there for us to ask? You should at least give feedback to them and then a 30th. Sir, customers are asking like this. I will tell you. This is recorded from their home only.

I am telling you sir, In kitchen 2 feet wall plus distance is four feet. You can 12 How many feet will be left if 3ft goes in the lawn? 10 ft by 12 feet is left. Actually I want to buy, but I am seeing the typical plan. There is no common bathroom anywhere in our house. If any guest comes out and sleeps inside a bedroom, we have to disturb them. We have two guest bedrooms here. One master's bed room and one guest bedroom. Yes there are three bedrooms. In this guest Bedroom means that if a guest comes he will go and sleep outside. If someone else sleeps out I am taking 22-24 years of safety. It costs about 1.76 crores. Okay sir Then when guests come to stay here they should either get up or go to the bathroom?
